    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I am the son of Maria di Angelo and the death lord Hades. Zeus blasted the building in which my mother, my sister and I lived. My dad erased our memories and we lived in the Lotus Hotel where we stayed for 70 years unaged. I fought the battle to rescue the olympus along with Percy Jackson. I now have greater control over my powers. Try me.</p>
